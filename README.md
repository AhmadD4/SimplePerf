# SimplePerf
Simpleperf is a simple network performance measuring tool, which includes two main components: a client and a server.
In today ÃÅs connected world, fast and reliable network connectivity is essential for businesses and individuals alike. To ensure that networks are performing at their optimal level, it is important to measure and monitor their bandwidth. The purpose of this project is to present the results of our study on measuring the bandwidth of a network.

My approach to the solution involves using a network testing tool called iPerf. In this project, I will design and implement my own simplified version of iPerf using socket. My simpleperf tool will run on a virtual network managed by Mininet inside a virtual machine. I will use it to measure the performance of a network.
